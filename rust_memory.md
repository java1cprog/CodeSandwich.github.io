# Introduction
Rust is a new programming language bringing new quality to code. You might have heard about it being fast, secure or safe to implement concurrency with. This introduction is focused on probably the most important, core feature of Rust: memory management. This system is the biggest language innovation and most of its unique features are direct consequences of this design.
